# BITWISE-OPERATOORS-
Bitwise operators change/manipulate the given input or data at individual bits level. They operate on integer operands treating them as sequence of binary digits.

Bitwise AND(&): Performs logical AND on corresponding bits of 2 inputs.
Bitwise OR(|): Performs logical OR on corresponding bits of 2 inputs.
Bitwise XOR(^): Performs logical XOR on corresponding bits of 2 inputs.
Bitwise NOT(~): Performs logical NOT on corresponding input.
Left shift(<<): Shifts the desired bit to 2 spaces left.
Right shift(>>): Shifts the desired bit to 2 spaces right.
